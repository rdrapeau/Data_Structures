Data_Structures
===============

In order to prep for the upcoming intern hunting season, I have implemented various elementary data structures as practice.

Implemented:
============
* ArrayList - using the basic array
* SinglyLinkedList
* DoublyLinkedList
* Queue - using the basic array
* Queue - using a linked list
* Queue - using two stacks
* Stack - using a basic array
* Stack - using a linked list
* Stack - using two queues
* DoubleStack - two stacks using one basic array
* TopplingStack - a new stack is created once the previous gets too high
* BinarySearchTree
* K-Tree - also known as a N-ary Tree
* Heap (Min and Max)
* Graph - using an adjacency list
*   Vertex
*   Edge
